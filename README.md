## Project Structure

- **src/**: This folder contains all the source code for the application. It includes:
  - **JavaScript files** for the calculator's logic and functionality.
  - **CSS and HTML files** to define main structure off app and for styling the calculator and theme.
  - **Components** including calculator.js and theme.js to separate all.
- **dist/**: This folder contains the compiled output generated by Webpack. It is used for:

  - Hosting the production-ready version of the application.
  - Bundled and minified files that **index.html, main.js, main.css** to improve loading times and performance.

- **configurations/** They are:
  **Webpack config files** to set up the build process.
  - **Babel config files** for transpiling modern JavaScript code and other browsers.
  - **Husky config** for managing Git hooks and ensuring code quality with pre-commit.
  - **ESLint config** for linting JavaScript code and maintaining code standards.
  - **Prettier config** for code formatting to ensure a consistent style.
  - Any other configuration files needed for plugins or tools.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

### 1. Initial Setup

- Created a new directory for the project.
- Initialized the project with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### 2. HTML Structure

- Developed the basic structure of the calculator in `index.html`, including:
  - A container for the calculator.
  - Input field for displaying calculations.
  - Buttons for numbers and operations.
- Used semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility.

### 3. CSS Styling

- Designed the layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.
- Improved visual aesthetics by:
  - Setting background colors and padding.
  - Styling buttons with hover effects for better user interaction.
  - Ensured the input field aligns text to the right for a cleaner look.

### 4. JavaScript Functionality

- Implemented event listeners for button clicks.
- Developed functions to handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage
  sign change).
- Added functionality to clear the input and handle decimal numbers.

### 5. Code Optimization and Performance Improvements
 
- **Enhanced code quality and maintainability** by integrating development tools:
  - **ESLint**: Used to enforce coding standards and catch errors during development, ensuring consistent code quality.
  - **Prettier**: Implemented for automatic code formatting, helping maintain a clean and readable codebase.
  - **Husky**: Set up to manage Git hooks, preventing commits if there are linting errors, thus ensuring only quality code is pushed.
  - **Lint-Staged**: Used in combination with Husky to run linters on staged files only, improving pre-commit performance.
  
- **Bundled and optimized assets** using:
  - **Webpack**: Configured for efficient module bundling, allowing for faster load times and better management of project assets.
  - **Babel**: Utilized to transpile modern JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across different browsers while maintaining optimal performance.

## Tools and Technologies

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing functionality and interactivity.
- **VS Code**: Used as the code editor for development.
- **Git**: For version control and project management.

## Conclusion

This calculator project demonstrates the fundamental principles of web development by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
